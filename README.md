## Transport-NBI backoffice
### Purpose

This repository contains the models used to validate the JSON code
for the [transport-nbi](https://github.com/danielkinguk/transport-nbi.git) activity
using the validation chain in [json-yang](https://github.com/GianmarcoBruno/json-yang.git).
There is one directory per JSON document containing the document itself and a `run.sh` script.
